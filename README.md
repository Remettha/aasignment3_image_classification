# Assignment 3 – Image Classification (Cat vs Dog)

## Overview
This project is part of my internship assignments.  
In this assignment, I used a simple Machine Learning (ML) model called *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* to classify images as *Cat* or *Dog*.

I worked with 4 images:
- cat1.jpg
- cat2.jpg
- dog1.jpg
- dog2.jpg

## Steps Done
1. Uploaded all images (2 cats and 2 dogs) into *Google Colab*.
2. Wrote Python code using *OpenCV* and *scikit-learn* libraries.
3. Resized each image to 64x64 pixels for easy processing.
4. Flattened each image into numbers (pixel values).
5. Trained a *KNN model* with:
   - *0 = Cat*
   - *1 = Dog*
6. Tested the classifier with a test image to check if it correctly predicts *“This is a CAT”* or *“This is a DOG.”*
